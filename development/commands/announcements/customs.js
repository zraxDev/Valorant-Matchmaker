It's also embarrassing.\n> ‚Ä¢ You are not allowed to invite your friends to spectate in the VALORANT lobby. They must be in the server in a spectator VC. This is to prevent cheating.\n> ‚Ä¢ Issue with the match? Ping the host with what your issue is and an image/clip to provide some context. If related to disconnects, please let the host know so they can adjust the rating given/lost from the inactive player.\n\n‚úÖ **React for Attendance!** ‚úÖ\nCheck the title for the time and ensure that you are using the correct time zones.\n\nüåü **Don't Miss Out!** üåü\n\nWhether you're a pro or a newcomer, our VALORANT custom games offer a competitive experience combining strategy, aim, and communications and making friends.\n\nJoin Now and Unleash Your Inner Champion!`)
